<h3 align="center">  Wind Turbine Power Production in Neom city</h3>

  <p align="center">
NEOM is where the present and future of renewable energy converge. Thanks to its location, it offers a unique vantage point for leveraging wind power in one innovative dual system, paving the way for the next frontier in clean energy.
 ÃÅ Renewable energy remains one of the most important topics for a sustainable future. Wind, being a perennial source of power, could be utilized to satisfy our power requirements. With the rise of wind farms, wind power forecasting would prove to be quite useful.
  
  
  
  
  in our project there is a solution based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks
The model performed well on the training data as well as the test data, and the measurement used to estimate the accuracy of the model is mean squared error
It is presented where the model is trained with a dataset and forecasts the hourly wind turbine power production for 41 days
